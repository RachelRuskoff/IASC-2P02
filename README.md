## Bio

I am a second year at Brock University studying Interactive Arts and Science. I hope to learn new development skills to establish a good understanding of digital humanities. My research focus is cultural studies specifically on how technology and digital media influence a certain culture. I want to learn more about how technology and digital media may affect different cultures and what makes cultures react to subjects differently. I also wish to learn more about different cultures in general to gain a better understanding of the world and the people in different nations. Cultural studies can be seen a bit in my research presentation on Sony’s Mini Disc. I discussed its role at the time it was invented and how it failed to adapt to the American culture. I expanded on the influences that were present in cultures or countries at that time that lead to the Mini Disc’s failure. In the future, I hope to expand my knowledge of different cultures because I plan to use it for teaching English as a second language. I want to use this knowledge, so I can become accustomed to different cultures to be able to connect and hopefully inspire my future students.

## Featured Project: Research Presentation

For the research presentation, I had to choose an old form of media and present it to fellow classmates in a Pecha Kucha format. I decided to examine the Sony MiniDisc because I found it interesting that despite its failure, the MiniDisc has a loyal following until today. I found out the MiniDisc required a lot of planning prior to its release. However, by the time it was available for purchase, it was considered out of date. Many competitors released devices with greater features and many of those devices costed less than the MiniDisc. For the presentation, I dissected the history of the MiniDisc into slideshow headings and elaborated on the topics. I wanted to share the reasons why it failed since it seemed to be a passionate and innovative project for Sony. Many claimed it was ‘the future of music’ but it never reached that potential. I believe learning about the MiniDisc is significant for Digital Humanities because it displays the impact trends have on society. MiniDisc provides commentary on how cultures change over time and why things should appeal to that specific era if they want to succeed. The MiniDisc shows how many societies have become more materialistic over the years since they typically focus wanted items. Many people feel compelled to buy something simply because it’s new. It is the norm for culture to surround themselves with unneeded items for status or fulfillment. The MiniDisc demonstrated the start of a new wave of materialism in different cultures.

Over time I had made some changes to my research presentation based on feedback. The biggest disadvantage of my presentation was the lack of relation to media archeology. This needed to be fixed since the main component of this project was to relate an old device to media archeology and explain its importance. To find a solution, I went through the feedback and made my changes based on what I lacked. I added 5 more slides for the explanation and added headers to organize different points. The first change I made can be seen [here](https://github.com/RachelRuskoff/IASC-2P02/commit/bb0fbf98be11fa25dc7b99a9bb58f8553954f070) I wanted to state why the MiniDisc was important to the time of that era and now. I explained that the focus of MiniDisc was to make a device for the enjoyment of music and that has escalated a lot today. Another change I made shown [here](https://github.com/RachelRuskoff/IASC-2P02/commit/b390dbfac84aee9655d78ab5a07b13c1ae4c7485) is the explanation of why MiniDisc failed and why it is important to know. The MiniDisc failed to comply with the times it was invented in. Instead of creating improvement for the MiniDisc, other devices were made to make up for what it lacked leading it to be forgotten. This sparked a new trend in device culture as having the latest gadget was considered ‘cool’. The final change I made [here](https://github.com/RachelRuskoff/IASC-2P02/commit/fc238e25193723bafe43109643b63b934d1c8e95) was relating it to today’s society and how MiniDisc represents a new outlook. I wanted to explain the importance of this new outlook on technology and society. I went into a further explanation on how the MiniDisc failure shows the norm of technology today.
