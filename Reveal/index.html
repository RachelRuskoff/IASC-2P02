				<section>
				<h2> What Is the Mini Disc? </h2>
				<p> Mini Disc (MD) is a magneto-optical disc-based data storage unit. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2>What Was It Capable of? </h2>
				<p> It could hold 74 minutes (later 80) of digital audio or 1 GB of Hi-MD data (a later development.) </p>			
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2> What Was It Used For? </h2>
				<p> It's main use was for music audio or recording. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section> 
				<h2> Development </h2>
				<p> The first Mini Disc was created by Sony in 1992. </p>
				<p> It's intention was to replace the Philips Compact Cassette analog audio tape system. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section> 
				<h2> Rivals </h2>
				<p> Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), created by Philips and Matsushita was created at the same time. </p>
				<p> Signaled the falling out between Sony and Philips. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2> Did It Do Well? </h2>
				<p> Nope. Not really. </p>
				<p> It was popular in Japan and had moderate success in Europe, but never took off anywhere else especially NA). </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h2> Why Did It Fail? </h2>
				<p> So, so many reasons. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<p> Sony intended the Digital Audio Tape to be the dominant home recording device and replace analog cassette.</p>
				<p> By the time DAT was released, the US dollar had fallen so far against the yen, the price needed to be doubled to break even ($400 to $800). </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<p> DAT became restricted to professional use, by the time they made the simple home version (MD) in 1992, they had to compete with Philips. </p>
				<p> Companies prefered DDC </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<p> Despite being intended for music, very little albums were released on Mini Discs. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<p> New competition from recordable compact disc (CD-R). </p>
				<p> CD-R unexpectly became affordable for home use in 1996. </p>
