				<h2> What Is the Mini Disc? </h2>
				<p> Mini Disc (MD) is a magneto-optical disc-based data storage unit. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4065/4375563128_1a31c9283c_b.jpg">
				<h2>What Was It Capable of? </h2>
				<p> It could hold 74 minutes (later 80) of digital audio or 1 GB of Hi-MD data (a later development.) </p>			
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/WikiGrenier_-_Lecteur_Sony_Mini_Disc_03.jpg">
				<h2> What Was It Used For? </h2>
				<p> It's main use was for music audio or recording. </p>
				</section>

				<h2> Development </h2>
				<p> The first Mini Disc was created by Sony in 1992. </p>
				<p> It's intention was to replace the Philips Compact Cassette analog audio tape system. </p>
				</section>

				<h2> Rivals </h2>
				<p> Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), created by Philips and Matsushita was created at the same time. </p>
				<p> Signaled the falling out between Sony and Philips. </p>

				<h2> Did It Do Well? </h2>
				<p> Nope. Not really. </p>
				<p> It was popular in Japan and had moderate success in Europe, but never took off anywhere else (especially NA). </p>

				<h2> Why Did It Fail? </h2>
				<p> So, so many reasons. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ba/c8/ac/bac8aca99fb87341d56a0a9016df3cba--digital-audio-audiophile.jpg">
				<p> Sony intended the Digital Audio Tape to be the dominant home recording device and replace analog cassette.</p>
				<p> By the time DAT was released, the US dollar had fallen so far against the yen, the price needed to be doubled to break even ($400 to $800). </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/radioshack-780x585.jpg">
				<p> DAT became restricted to professional use, by the time they made the simple home version (MD) in 1992, they had to compete with Philips. </p>
				<p> Companies (like RadioShack) prefered DDC. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="http://www.minidisc.org/images/pops_labels.jpg">
				<p> Despite being intended for music, very little albums were released on Mini Discs. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/CD-RW_bottom.jpg/1200px-CD-RW_bottom.jpg">
				<p> New competition from recordable compact disc (CD-R). </p>
				<p> CD-R unexpectly became affordable for home use in 1996. </p>

				<h2> Why Did It Die? </h2>
				<p> Its biggest competition of MP3 players became mainstream. </p>
				<p> First, the Diamond Rio player in 1998 and then the iPod (file-based systems were preferred over phyical copies.) </p>

				<h2> Was It Impactful to the Tech Industry? </h2>
				<p> Yes, in a way. </p>
				<p> It helped inspire the format for music and the transition of phyical to digital. </p>
